# Diary-system


A Diary system consisting of a Task Manager and an Image Gallery. This was a fun project to expand my knowledge on Web based projects. 

Task Manager was done using Mongo Db, Express Js, React Js, Node Js  [MERN] stack to complete the work. The Task Manager can list out numerous tasks and check mark if completed. It can perform all the Create, Read, Update, Delete [CRUD] operations which is linked to cloud Mongo Database. 

Image Gallery is the place where we can drag and drop or select images which statically stored. We can upload or just drag and drop multiple images at once. Upon refreshing the page all the images are removed. 

Soon will be coming up with more updates to upgrade this project, Do come back and check for more updates.. 

Steps:

1] Download the code zip file or clone the project using URL.

2] Open with any code Editor

3] Run the command npm install on terminal to install all the packages

4] Run the command npm start for each component to run on respective ports.

Stay tuned more updates to come....
Happy Coding !!!
